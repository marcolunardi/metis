    "Cluster sentences with K-means. If you have your own Fletcher test data, get sentences out and cluster them. If not, cluster the tweets you gathered during the last challenge set. For each cluster, print out the sentences, try to see how close the sentences are. Try different K values and try to find a K value that makes the most sense (the sentences look like they do form a meaningful cluster).\n",

    "For each cluster, find the sentence closest to the centroid of the cluster. (You can use sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances or scipy.spatial.distance [check pdist, cdist, and euclidean distance] to find distances to the centroid). KMeans has a cluster_centroids_ attribute. This sentence (closest to centroid) is now the name of the cluster. For each cluster, print the representative sentence, and print 'N people expressed a similar statement', or something like that relevant to your dataset. (This is very close to what amazon used to do in the reviews section up to a year ago.)\n",

    "Cluster the same data with MiniBatchKMeans. MiniBatchKMeans is a fast way to apply K-means to large data without much loss -- The results are very similar. Instead of using EVERY single point to find the new place of the centroid, MiniBatch just randomly samples a small number (like 100) in the cluster to calculate the new center. Since this is usually very close to the actual center, the algorithm gets there much faster. Try it and compare the results. Example on two-feature data\n",

    "Download this dataset on the purchase stats from clients of a wholesale distributor. Cluster the clients based on their annual spending features (fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, delicatessen). Remember to scale the features before clustering. After finding a reasonable amount of clusters, for EACH cluster, plot the histogram for every single feature: FRESH, MILK, GROCERY, FROZEN, DETERGENTS_PAPER, DELICATESSEN, CHANNEL, REGION. Is there a natural way to characterize each cluster? How would you describe each cluster to the wholesale distributor if you were working for them?"
